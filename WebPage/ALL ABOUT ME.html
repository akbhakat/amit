<strong>Arduino</strong> is an open-source hardware and software company. You can make anything you like till you know C++. It is not very hard . It maybe a little hard at first, but you'll get used to it. It is a nice thing to do in free time and summer holidays both for kids, and adults.

Space
</H1>
<p>
As I mentioned before, my Ambition is to be a SPACE SCIENTIST, so I love space. The moon, the sun, the planets , the stars and so many things! So what is space you ask? <strong>Space</strong> is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. The sun,planets,stars, all these are a part of the space. Here is a fact on space.. SPACE IS COMPLETELY SILENT.

Chocolates
</H1>
<p>
Now, who does not love chocolates! Chocolate is a preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds that is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, which may also be used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Chocolate is a range of foods derived from cocoa, mixed with fat and finely powdered sugar to produce a solid confectionery. There are several types of chocolate, classified according to the proportion of cocoa used in a particular formulation.Hershey's chocolate is made from cacao beans, milk, sugar, and cocoa butter, but the actual chocolate-making process begins long before that. In fact, it's a fascinating but labor-intensive process that will make you appreciate every sweet bite. Cacao trees bear fruit, and inside those fruits are seeds. The most popular chocolate milk is Nestle Nesquik.

Coding

<body>
Coding is lots of fun.You can code in many languages. Some of them are C++,Java, Javascript,html, python, Pearl etc.. Now, there are apps for writing codes and making apps. Like there is Code.org for Javascript( drag and drop and writing),Adriuno for C++ that is used as coding for hardware (for writing in text only). You see, coding is not as hard as you think... you just need to give it time and practice. Click <a href = "https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/62qiF8UMXIBr2M3gJBG-8svTm_ylk-7IoabEo9OEt8Q"> here </a> to see a code I wrote. And remember, codeing is for everyone!!
